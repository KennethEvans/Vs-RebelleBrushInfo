# Rebelle Brush Info

Rebelle Brush Info is a C# Windows application that reads Rebelle brush files and displays them in a readable form. It can also compare two brushes and show the differences. This can be useful for seeing the structure of the brush parameters and to easily compare the differences between two brushes.

It is currently in early development.
